 * * maxFreeSockets <number> Maximum number of sockets to leave open in a free state. Only relevant if keepAlive is set to true. Default: 256.
 * * timeout <number> Socket timeout in milliseconds. This will set the timeout when the socket is created.

/**
 * Class: http.ClientRequest
 * This object is created internally and returned from http.request(). It represents an in-progress request whose header has already been queued. The header is still mutable using the setHeader(name, value), getHeader(name), removeHeader(name) API. The actual header will be sent along with the first data chunk or when calling request.end().
 * To get the response, add a listener for 'response' to the request object. 'response' will be emitted from the request object when the response headers have been received. The 'response' event is executed with one argument which is an instance of http.IncomingMessage.
 * During the 'response' event, one can add listeners to the response object; particularly to listen for the 'data' event.
 * If no 'response' handler is added, then the response will be entirely discarded. However, if a 'response' event handler is added, then the data from the response object must be consumed, either by calling response.read() whenever there is a 'readable' event, or by adding a 'data' handler, or by calling the .resume() method. Until the data is consumed, the 'end' event will not fire. Also, until the data is read it will consume memory that can eventually lead to a 'process out of memory' error.
 * Node.js does not check whether Content-Length and the length of the body which has been transmitted are equal or not.

 * * port <number> Port of remote server. Default: 80.
 * * localAddress <string> Local interface to bind for network connections.
 * * socketPath <string> Unix Domain Socket (cannot be used if one of host or port is specified, those specify a TCP Socket).
 * * method <string> A string specifying the HTTP request method. Default: 'GET'.
 * * path <string> Request path. Should include query string if any. E.G. '/index.html?page=12'. An exception is thrown when the request path contains illegal characters. Currently, only spaces are rejected but that may change in the future. Default: '/'.
 * * headers <Object> An object containing request headers.

 * * 0 (default): use http.globalAgent for this host and port.
