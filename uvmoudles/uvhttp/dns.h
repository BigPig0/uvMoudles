/**
* Supported getaddrinfo flags
The following flags can be passed as hints to dns.lookup().

dns.ADDRCONFIG: Returned address types are determined by the types of addresses supported by the current system. For example, IPv4 addresses are only returned if the current system has at least one IPv4 address configured. Loopback addresses are not considered.
dns.V4MAPPED: If the IPv6 family was specified, but no IPv6 addresses were found, then return IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses. Note that it is not supported on some operating systems (e.g FreeBSD 10.1).

/**
 * dns.lookup(hostname[, options], callback)
 * hostname <string>
 * options <integer> | <Object>
 *    family <integer> The record family. Must be 4 or 6. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both returned by default.
 *    hints <number> One or more supported getaddrinfo flags. Multiple flags may be passed by bitwise ORing their values.
 *    all <boolean> When true, the callback returns all resolved addresses in an array. Otherwise, returns a single address. Default: false.
 *    verbatim <boolean> When true, the callback receives IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the order the DNS resolver returned them. When false, IPv4 addresses are placed before IPv6 addresses. Default: currently false (addresses are reordered) but this is expected to change in the not too distant future. New code should use { verbatim: true }.
 * callback <Function>
 *    err <Error>
 *    address <string> A string representation of an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
 *    family <integer> 4 or 6, denoting the family of address.
 * Resolves a hostname (e.g. 'nodejs.org') into the first found A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6) record. All option properties are optional. If options is an integer, then it must be 4 or 6 C if options is not provided, then IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.

 * With the all option set to true, the arguments for callback change to (err, addresses), with addresses being an array of objects with the properties address and family.
 * On error, err is an Error object, where err.code is the error code. Keep in mind that err.code will be set to 'ENOENT' not only when the hostname does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways such as no available file descriptors.
 * dns.lookup() does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol. The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names with addresses, and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some time to consult the Implementation considerations section before using dns.lookup().

Fallback DNS servers will only be used if the earlier ones time out or result in some other error.
